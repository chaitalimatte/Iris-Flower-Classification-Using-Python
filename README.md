# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Python
The Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning project widely used to introduce beginners to data science concepts. The dataset, called the Iris dataset, consists of 150 records of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each record includes four numerical features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—which are used as inputs to predict the correct species. In Python, libraries like Pandas and NumPy are used for loading and analyzing the dataset, while Matplotlib and Seaborn help in visualizing patterns and relationships between features. For example, petal length and petal width show clear separations among species when plotted. Once the data is understood, machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are applied using scikit-learn. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance, and accuracy scores are calculated to measure how well the model classifies new data. Typically, models like KNN and SVM achieve high accuracy on this dataset. This project demonstrates the full pipeline of machine learning: data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in Python-based machine learning.
